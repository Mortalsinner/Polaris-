# Polaris+

Polaris+ is a static website that provide daily information about our galaxies using the Nasa API.
We're planning to expand this program, by integrating the mars weather API.

## How it's made?

Polaris+ are made using React.JS, Nasa API, and Tailwincss along with DaisyUI,
in the mean time we're only using CDN for Tailwind and DaisyUI.
